/**
 * Reducers Redux
 *
 * The reducer will be who is in charge of our data. Using actions
 * we can update the status of our application.
 *
 * To create a new reducer:
 * const INITIAL_STATE = {} // initial state of the application
 *
 * export const example = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {
 *    switch (action.type) {
 *      case EXAMPLE:
 *        return { ...state }
 *      default:
 *        return state // return { ...state }
 *    }
 * }
 *
