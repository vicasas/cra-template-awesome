/**
 * Action Redux
 *
 * Actions change things in your app. This is the only way the application
 * interacts with the state, ensuring it is always up to date.
 *
 * To add a new action:
 * import { EXAMPLE } from './constants/example'
 *
 * export const example = () => (dispatch, getState) => {
 *    dispatch({ type: EXAMPLE })
 * }
 *
